## ⚙️ Environment Setup


Setup project by running the following commands:



```bash
# Example -- overwrite if needed
conda create -n rq-vae python=3.9
source activate rq-vae
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or execute the `install_enviroment.job` script

---

## 📂 Download & Prepare Datasets

All your dataset is being downloaded and prepared by the code in the folder `data`. If you want to add more datasets follow their example.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Set your parameters in the config file before training. As a training configuration example see `configs/rqvae_amazon.gin` and for evaluation configuration example see `configs/decoder_amazon.gin`


---

## 🚀 5. Training

### Baselines

Run the following command to train the baseline:

```bash
python  train_rqvae.py configs/decoder_amazon.gin
```

Alternatively, execute the following slurm job:

```bash
sbatch job_scripts/run_training_amazon.job
```

---

## 📈 Evaluation

After training, evaluate all models with:

```bash
python train_decoder.py configs/decoder_amazon.gin
```

Alternatively, execute the following slurm job:

```bash
sbatch job_scripts/run_evaluation_amazon.job
```

---

## ⚙️ Gini Coeffision

You can use the gini coeffision only if 
    1. You have a category and you have defined it in the .gin configuration
    2. You have not create the dataset

If you dont have both then delete the dataset folder and re-run it so that the categories can be created!

The Gini Coeffision is only made for the AmazonReview dataset. If you want to add it to another dataset then you need to configure that file.
